#### In 2024 | 2025 
I'm putting all of this here because posting publicly, especially about to do lists, is half the battle and keeps me motivated!

I'm up to A LOT. This year (2024), I've fallen in love with the Crystal programming language,
explored custom plugin development for OBS (Online Braodcating Software), have began building
bespoke tools and possible products for the ever-growing content / live streaming community. 
With all of the recent new releases of languages and frameworks this fall (Rails8, Angular19, Kotlin 2.0 & Ktor 3),
and many more, I find myself exploring ideas and building more and more as fast as I can.

Starting in January 2025, I'm joining the Code:You organization as a mentor. Other than building my own tools, software, and products,
while working professionally as a developer, I've felt the need to branch out into teaching, coaching, content creation, streaming,
building in public, and having a greater impact professionally outside of 'just code'.
